 In the first section of this paper. I demonstrate the relevance of our dictionary with use of topic modelling methods (latent dirichlet allocation and cosine similarities) and study the implications of topic discussion in both a strategic management context and an empirical finance context. I explain the reasons behind my findings with and co-movements of subtopics with fundamental and market based indicators. In the second section of this paper, I explore the joint use of this dictionary with supervised machine learning techniques. Overall, this paper intends a complete analysis workflow focusing on combining the dictionary with machine learning applications to elicit future research in the area of topic modelling within empirical finance.
